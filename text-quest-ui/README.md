### Basic Interactions

- "go to"
- "look at"
- "pick up"
- "use"

For example, if you are in a room with a treasure chest in the center, then you could...

> look at Treasure Chest

"you see the chest in the center of the room, it looks old, and maybe filled with great riches"

> go to Treasure Chest

"you approach the chest. As you get closer you get a strange feeling and could almost swear you saw the chest flex and move"

> use Treasure Chest

"as you reach out to touch the chest, it quivers and shifts before your eyes...this is no chest. It'a a mimic!"

### Combat Interactions

- "melee"
- "flee"
- "cast"
- "shoot"

For example...after the mimic makes itself known

> melee Mimic

"you swiftly draw your dagger and slash at the Mimic, which has morphed into its full natural toothy horror form. However, your slahes do little"

> cast Ray of Frost

"you cast the spell Ray of Frost, shooting ice from your hands. You can see the creatures skin freeze as the spell hits it"

> flee

"you look to flee: which exit? (1): south door, (2): east door

> 1

"you rush to the south door. It's still open, and you manage to slip out, and slam it behind you before the creature catches up"

### Social Interactions

- "speak to"
- "charm"
- "cower"
- "barter"

For example...you find yourself trying to gain entrace to a castle...

"The guard looks tired, and his tone suggests he has little time for any nonsense"

> speak to Guard

"Who are you? This place is kept tight. No chance you're getting in here"

> charm Guard

"You do your best to sound friendly, and tell the guard that you're just looking to bring some food to your brother, whose training in the yard"

> cower Guard

"You puff yourself up looking as ferocious as you can manage, and attempt to intimidate the guard into letting you pass"
